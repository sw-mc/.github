## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a work in progress, self sustained bedrock server software written in C#.
This is going to be officially used on [SkyWarped](https://github.com/skywarped-mc) when it is stable.

Unlike other server software, this project will be 100% community driven, meaning it is meant to be as modular as possible while still sustaining its status as a server software. Unlike all of its competetitors it is not only a software, but a library as well. Meaning it has built in plugin support or it can be started as a library.
